# TODO
# Show more info on processes, for example the user that spawned them, or if
# they're being debugged or not.

# TODO
# Show threads in each process (optionally).

# TODO
# Get the names of the services running in each process.

# TODO
# How about showing some colors?
# It'd be useful when using a search string, to highlight the matching parts.
# Also to show processes run by SYSTEM or other users with different colors.
