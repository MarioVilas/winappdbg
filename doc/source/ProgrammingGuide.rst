Programming guide
*****************

This guide will show you through the most commonly used classes and methods of the *WinAppDbg* module, and provide some examples of use for each one. The goal is to give you a bird's eye perspective on what the library can do and how, without having to go through the `reference material <http://winappdbg.sourceforge.net/doc/v1.4/reference/>`_.
